# Belly Button BioDiversity Dashboard
## Summary
The purpose of this project is to explore the data of subject's belly button washing habits and to visualize the results in three forms: a bar chart, a wash frequency gauge, and a bubble chart. These charts explore the bacteria cultures found within subject's belly buttons and the viewer can assess the connections between the cultures found and wash frequency.
